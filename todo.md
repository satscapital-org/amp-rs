- [ ] Fix get_gaid_registered_user  
- [ ] Add error handling tests for edge cases
  - Create mock tests for invalid registered user IDs
  - Create mock tests for invalid GAIDs
  - Create mock tests for invalid asset UUIDs
  - Create mock tests for invalid category IDs
  - Create mock tests for authentication failures
  - Create mock tests for network errors and retry scenarios
  - Verify proper error types are returned for each failure mode
  - Each test must use setup_mock_test() and cleanup_mock_test() helpers
  - Each test must call cleanup_mock_test() in a defer/finally block or at test end to ensure cleanup occurs even if test fails
